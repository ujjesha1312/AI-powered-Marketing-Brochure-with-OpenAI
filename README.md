# AI-Powered Marketing Brochure Generator

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Marketing Brochure Generator** â€” a tool that automatically creates well-structured marketing brochures by intelligently scraping company websites and summarizing content using OpenAI's GPT-4.

Whether you're showcasing a company to investors, introducing it to potential hires, or compiling research, this tool helps automate the process using the power of AI.

## What It Does

- Scrapes a companyâ€™s website (landing page + relevant subpages)
- Identifies key pages (About, Careers, etc.)
- Extracts and cleans content using BeautifulSoup
- Summarizes using OpenAI GPT-4 API
- Outputs a clean, markdown-formatted brochure
- Supports live streaming of the response in Jupyter/IPython

## Example Use Case

Imagine you want a quick summary of a company like Hugging Face for a pitch deck or student research. Instead of browsing multiple pages, this tool fetches and summarizes everything in seconds.
